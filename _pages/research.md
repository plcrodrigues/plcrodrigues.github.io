<h1>Research</h1>

In this page I summarize some of the research questions that I've investigated up to today. You can also check the **<a href="/publications/">publications</a>** page for a full list of my published papers. Please feel free to **<a href = "mailto: pedro.rodrigues@melix.org">contact me</a>** if you would like to discuss further some of these research topics.

Bayesian inference on modern complex simulator models is in general a difficult task because the likelihood function of the modelâ€™s output is often intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) bypasses such obstacle by <span style="color:#00b050">approximating the posterior distribution</span> using a flexible function (e.g. a neural network) trained over simulations on different parameters.

Multivariate time series are the standard tool for describing and analysing 
measurements from multiple sensors during an experiment. I've been interested in
mathematical <span style="color:#00b050">representations that are invariant</span> to transformations occurring in practical situations, such as changes in instrument calibration and different experimental
setups for measuring the same phenomenon.

Characterizing neural connectivity has become central to <span style="color:#00b050">understanding the brain</span>
and its status under different stimulus and/or behavioural conditions. Amidst the diversity of currently available
approaches, those based on modeling stationary multivariate time series remain the most popular ones thanks to the wide avaliability of off-the-shelf linear modeling routines and decades of practical experience.
