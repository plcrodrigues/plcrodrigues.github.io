<h1>Research</h1>

In this page I summarize some of the research questions that I've investigated 
up to today. Please feel free to **<a href = "mailto: pedro.rodrigues@melix.org">contact me</a>** if you would like to discuss further some of these topics.

## Simulation-based inference

Bayesian inference on modern complex simulator models is in general a difficult 
task because the likelihood function of the modelâ€™s output is often intractable. 
Simulation-based inference (SBI) bypasses such obstacle by <span style="color:#00b050">approximating the posterior distribution</span> using a flexible function (e.g. a neural network) trained over simulations on different parameters.

## Exploring invariances of multivariate time series

Multivariate time series are the standard tool for describing and analysing 
measurements from multiple sensors during an experiment. I've been interested in
mathematical <span style="color:#00b050">representations that are invariant</span> to transformations occurring in practical situations, such as changes in instrument calibration and different experimental
setups for measuring the same phenomenon.

## Neural connectivity estimation

Characterizing neural connectivity has become central to <span style="color:#00b050">understanding the brain</span>
and its status under different stimulus and/or behavioural conditions. Amidst the diversity of currently available
approaches, those based on modeling stationary multivariate time series remain the most popular ones thanks to the wide avaliability of off-the-shelf linear modeling routines and decades of practical experience.
