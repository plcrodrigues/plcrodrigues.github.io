## Lectures (CM)

Slides

- CM1: Introduction and multiple linear regression [[pdf](https://plcrodrigues.github.io/sadm/CM1-slides.pdf)] (31-January-2022)

## Tutorials (TD)

Exercise worksheets

- TD1: Multiple linear regression [[pdf](https://plcrodrigues.github.io/sadm/TD1-text.pdf)] (31-January-2022)

## Lab works (TP)

Exercise worksheets

- TP1: Multiple linear regression (07-February-2022)
  - text [[pdf](https://plcrodrigues.github.io/sadm/TP1-text.pdf)]
  - prostate dataset [[data](https://plcrodrigues.github.io/sadm/TP1-prostate.data)] and reference [[pdf]()]

Rules

- Reports should be written in **english**.
- Lab works are to be done by groups of three students. A report has to be uploaded on Teide at the end of each thematic group of sessions (see deadlines on Teide). Use RMarkdown knitted html. The grade obtained on reports counts as half the final grade.
- Analysis and figures are to be produced with the R software. 
- Graphical representations are essential in statistics. Each figure must have its title, legend, and the axes should have their legends too. Each figure has to be explained (what stands in the figure?) commented and referred to in the report (using its number: "We can see from Fig. 3 that...".
