I like to write about things that I've learned. This helps me consolidate things
in my head and, if I'm lucky, help other people interested in the same topics
as me. 

Please, don't hesitate to write me at <span style="font-weight:bold">
pedro.rodrigues at inria dot fr</span> if you see any mistakes on my writing, 
if you have any suggestions of improvements, or if you just want to comment on
something I've written.
