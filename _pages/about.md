**Olá, I'm Pedro**. I am a post-doc researcher at the Parietal team from INRIA, France. My main research interest
is in developing machine learning methods for experimental sciences. A particular topic that I've been working on
lately is *simulation-based inference* and how it can be applied to computational neuroscience. Please check my <a href="/research.html" target="_blank">research page</a> for more information.

Prior to my post-doc, I did a Ph.D. at the GIPSA-lab, France, under the supervision of Marco Congedo and Christian Jutten. The title of my thesis is "Exploring invariances of multivariate time series via Riemannian geometry: validation on EEG data" and you can find it <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02345388" target="_blank">here</a>.

I hold a B.S. and a M.S. from the University of São Paulo, Brazil, and also a Diplôme de l'École Polytechnique (X2010), France. When not reading scientific papers or writing `python` code, I'm often hiking somewhere in the French alps.
