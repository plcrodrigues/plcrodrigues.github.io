## Works on simulation-based inference 
These publications are related to the research topic that I’ve been developping during my post-doc. Several collaborations are currently under progress with researchers from the University of Liège, Brown University and the ICTP in Italy.

  <li> PLC Rodrigues and A Gramfort. “<i>Learning summary features of time series likelihood free inference</i>”. Workshop on Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences at the 34th conference on NeurIPS. Online conference. December, 2020. <br>Parper available at arXiv:2012.02807.</li>
  <li>M Jallais, <u>PLC Rodrigues</u>, A Gramfort, D Wassermann. “<i>Cytoarchitecture measurements in brain gray matter using likelihood-free Inference</i>”. December, 2020. <br>Paper available at hal-03090959.</li>
</ol>

## Works on transfer learning
Both journal papers lay the mathematical foundations of my contributions in transfer learning for data defined in a SPD manifold. The other conference papers were all oral presentations, showing the growing interest of the research community in these methods.

## Works on dimensionality reduction
These were the first published works of my Ph.D. thesis. They are based on the widely known mathematical framework of diffusion maps and extend it to the case of data points defined in the symmetric-positive definite manifold. Reference [8] is the first work in the literature, to the best of my knowledge, that applies these concepts to the analysis of multivariate time series.
