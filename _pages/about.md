My name is Pedro Rodrigues and I am post-doc at the Parietal team from INRIA, France. My main topic of interest at the moment is **simulation-based inference** and how to apply it to computational neuroscience.

Prior to my post-doc, I did a Ph.D. at the GIPSA-lab, France, under the supervision of Marco Congedo and Christian Jutten. The title of my thesis is "Exploring invariances of multivariate time series via Riemannian geometry: validation on EEG data" and it is available for download [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02345388). The idea of my thesis was to explore ways of applying machine learning tools to the analysis and classification of neural time series. The inspiration for most of my contributions came from practical problems involving EEG recordings from Brain-Computer Interfaces. Before coming to Grenoble for my Ph.D., I worked for two years as a graduate researcher under the supervision of professor Luiz A. Baccalá at the University of São Paulo. During this period, I developed algorithms for estimating neural connectivity with multivariate recordings from the brain.

I hold a B.S. and a M.S. from the University of São Paulo, Brazil, and also a Diplôme de l'École Polytechnique (X2010), France.
