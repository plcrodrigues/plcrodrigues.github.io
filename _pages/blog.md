# The Riemannian Gaussian distribution
With Salem Sa√Ød I've been working a lot on how to sample from the Riemannian Gaussian
distribution, a generalized version of our favorite probability distribution to the
space of symmetric positive definite matrices.

More precisely, the pdf looks like this: for $\boldsymbol{X} \in \mathcal{P}(d)$ we have

$$
p(\boldsymbol{X}) = \dfrac{1}{\zeta(\sigma)}\exp\left(-\dfrac{1}{2\sigma^2}\delta_R^2(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{I})\right)
$$
